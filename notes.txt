volumes in docker-compose.yaml syncs container with local files.  

imp to have .github/workflows/name.yaml to be in root project dir
    for github to pick up 

testing :
    SimpleTestCase
        no db creation 
        saves time in testing 
    TestCase 
        has db and used when needed db  

in TDD: 
    first write a test, to test a func, and then test that code 
    fail the rest and see the error, 
    add fucntionality and return dummy if possible and test to see if the testing module is picked
    then add actual fucntionality and return proper resuult and check 
    this way you kow the module/methods being tested for exists and it works the way its supposed to 

Mocking: 
    override or change behaviour of dependencies
    helps avoind unintended side effects
    helps isolate code being tested
    example - sending email testing, 
        in this mocking can be used to block actaul sending of email 
        and just check if send_email is called
        db testing and sleep fucntionality 
            instead of using sleep(default) waiting 5 seconds for db to be available, 
            can be replacd with a mock object to sleep of lower time and test the db instantly
